## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nchadha28107/Mobile_Automation.git
   cd mobile-automation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or above). Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Appium** (if not already installed):
   You can install Appium globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g appium
   ```

4. **Install Appium Doctor** (optional but recommended):
   To verify your Appium setup:
   ```bash
   npm install -g appium-doctor
   appium-doctor
   ```

5. **Set up your Android or iOS environment** according to the Appium documentation.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test -- --udid YOUR_UDID --tags '@yourTag'
```
- Replace `YOUR_UDID` with the UDID of your device (this is **mandatory**).
- Replace `@yourTag` with the specific tag you want to run (e.g., `@positive` or `@negative`). This parameter is **optional**.

## Generating Reports

After running the tests, you can generate HTML reports using the following command:
```bash
npm run generate-report
```
This will create an HTML report based on the JSON reports generated during the test run. The reports will be located in the `reports/html-report` directory.

## Future Enhancements

- **Support for iOS**: Extend the framework to support iOS testing. This would involve passing a platform parameter alongside the UDID to differentiate between Android and iOS devices during test execution.

- **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate with CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for automated test execution on code changes.

- **Enhanced Reporting**: Improve the reporting feature by including detailed logs and screenshots on test failures.

- **Custom Hooks**: Add before/after hooks for setting up and tearing down the test environment.

## Execution Recording

The execution recording has been attached in the file **Mobile_Automation_Recording.pptx**.
